# Iterables

`Interable` obejcts is a generalization of arrays. That's a concept that allows to make any object useable in a `for...of` loop.

## Symbol.iterator

> V: this section tell us how to implement a iterable obejct.

We can easily grasp the concept of iterables by making one of our own.

For instance, we have an object, that is not an array, but looks suitable for `for..of`.

Like a range object that represents an interval of numbers:

```js
let range = {
  from: 1,
  to: 5
};

// We want the for..of to work:
// for(let num of range) ... num=1,2,3,4,5
```

To make the `range` iterable (and thus let `for..of` work) we need to add a method to the object named `Symbol.iterator` (a special built-in symbol just for that).

1. When `for..of` starts, it calls that method once (or errors if not found). The method must return an iterator – an object with the method next.
2. Onward, `for..of` works only with that returned object.
3. When `for..of` wants the next value, it calls next() on that object.
4. The result of next() must have the form {done: Boolean, value: any}, where done=true means that the iteration is finished, otherwise value is the next value.

Here’s the full implementation for range with remarks:

```js
 let range = {
  from: 1,
  to: 5
};

// 1. call to for..of initially calls this
range[Symbol.iterator] = function() {

  // ...it returns the iterator object:
  // 2. Onward, for..of works only with this iterator, asking it for next values
  return {
    current: this.from,
    last: this.to,

    // 3. next() is called on each iteration by the for..of loop
    next() {
      // 4. it should return the value as an object {done:.., value :...}
      if (this.current <= this.last) {
        return { done: false, value: this.current++ };
      } else {
        return { done: true };
      }
    }
  };
};

// now it works!
for (let num of range) {
  alert(num); // 1, then 2, 3, 4, 5
}
```

Please note the core feature of iterables: separation of concerns.

- The `range` itself does not have the `next()` method.
- Instead, another object, a so-called “iterator” is created by the call to `range[Symbol.iterator]()`, and its `next()` generates values for the iteration.

So, the iterator object is separate from the object it iterates over.

Technically, we may merge them and use `range` itself as the iterator to make the code simpler.

Like this:

```js
 let range = {
  from: 1,
  to: 5,

  [Symbol.iterator]() {
    this.current = this.from;
    return this;
  },

  next() {
    if (this.current <= this.to) {
      return { done: false, value: this.current++ };
    } else {
      return { done: true };
    }
  }
};

for (let num of range) {
  alert(num); // 1, then 2, 3, 4, 5
}
```

Now `range[Symbol.iterator]()` returns the `range` object itself: it has the necessary `next()` method and remembers the current iteration progress in `this.current`. Shorter? Yes. And sometimes that’s fine too.

The downside is that now it’s impossible to have two `for..of` loops running over the object simultaneously: they’ll share the iteration state, because there’s only one iterator – the object itself. But two parallel for-ofs is a rare thing, even in async scenarios.

### Infinite iterators
Infinite iterators are also possible. For instance, the `range` becomes infinite for `range.to = Infinity`. Or we can make an iterable object that generates an infinite sequence of pseudorandom numbers. Also can be useful.

There are no limitations on `next`, it can return more and more values, that’s normal.

Of course, the `for..of` loop over such an iterable would be endless. But we can always stop it using break.

## String is iterable

```js
for (let char of 'test') {
  alert(char); // t, e, s, t
}

let str = '𝒳😂';
for (let char of str) {
    alert( char ); // 𝒳, and then 😂
}
```

## Calling an iterator explicitly

```js
let str = "Hello";

// does the same as
// for (let char of str) alert(char);

let iterator = str[Symbol.iterator]();

while (true) {
  let result = iterator.next();
  if (result.done) break;
  alert(result.value); // outputs characters one by one
}
```

## Iterables and array-likes

There are two official terms that look similar, but are very different. Please make sure you understand them well to avoid the confusion.

- `Iterables` are objects that implement the `Symbol.iterator` method, as described above.
- `Array-likes` are objects that have indexes and `length`, so they look like arrays.

Both iterables and array-likes are usually not arrays, they don’t have `push`, `pop` etc. That’s rather inconvenient if we have such an object and want to work with it as with an array. E.g. we would like to work with `range` using array methods. How to achieve that?

## Array.from

Takes an iterable or array-like value and makes a "real" `Array` from it.

```js
// Each element will pass to mapfn before adding to the array
Array.from(obj[, mapfn, thisArg])
```

## Summary

The result of `obj[Symbol.iterator]` is called an _iterator_. It handles the further iteration process.
