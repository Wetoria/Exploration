# Object.keys, values, entries

`Object`, `Map`, `Set` and `Array` support `keys()`, `values()` and `entries()` both.

But for objects, we should use these like `Object.keys`. And for `Object` the results of these methods are "real" array, for others, are iterator.

__Object.keys/values/entries ignore symbolic properties.__ If we want symbolic keys, use `Object.getOwnPropertySymbols` or `Reflect.ownKeys(obj)`.

## Transforming objects

Use `keys`, `values`, `entries` to get an array of object, then use the methods of `Array` to deal with the values, then turn it back into an object by `fromEntries`.
