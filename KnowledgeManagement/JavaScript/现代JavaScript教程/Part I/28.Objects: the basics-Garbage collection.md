# Garbage collection

## Reachability

The main concept of memory management in JavaScript is _reachability_.

1. Base set of inherently reachable values
    - Local variables and parameters of the current function.
    - Variables and parameters for other functions on the current chain of nested calls.
    - Global variables.
    - (there are some other, internal ones as well)  

    These values are called _roots_.

2. If some values are reachable from a root by a reference or by a chain of references.

The `garbage collector` will monitor all objects and remove those values that have become unreachable.

## Internal algorithms

__"mark-and-sweep"__

Garbage collector will travel all objects from roots, when an object was referenced, it will be marked. If an object cannot be reached, GC will remove it.

JavaScript has some optimizations:
- __Generational collection__ - "new ones" and "old ones". Many objects appear, do their job and fast, they can be cleaned up aggressively. Those that survive for long enough, become "od", and are examined less often.
- __Incremental collection__ - Use extra bookkeeping to get tiny delays instead of a big one.
- __Idle-time collection__ - the GC tries to run only while the CPU is idle.
- etc.
