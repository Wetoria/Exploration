# Function expressions

```js
let sayHi = function() {

};
```

## Callback functions

Pass a function as a parameter into a function, then, run the param function as you need.

## Function Expression vs Function Declaration

- A __Function Expression__ is created when the execution reaches it and is usable only from that moment.
- A __Function Declaration__ can be called earlier than it is defined.

Due to JavaScript internal algorithms. When JavaScript prepares to run the script, __it first looks for global Function Declarations in it and creates the functions__. We can think of it as an __"initialization stage"__.

```js
sayHi();

function sayHi() {
  alert('Hi');
}
```
