# WeakMap and WeakSet

```js
let john = { name: "John" };

// the object can be accessed, john is the reference to it

// overwrite the reference
john = null;

// the object will be removed from memory
```

If we add an object into an array, or we use an object as a key of a map, the object will still be reachable. So the GC will not remove that.

We can use `WeakMap`, it doesn't prevent garbage-collection of key objects.

## WeakMap

Differences between `Map` and `WeakMap`

1. `WeakMap` keys must be objects, not primitive values.
2. When an object has removed which is the key in a `WeakMap`, the value of it will be garbage collected automatically.


### Methods

`WeakMap` does not support iteration and methods `keys()`, `values()`, `entries()`. It has only the following methods:

- `weakMap.get(key)`
- `weakMap.set(key, value)`
- `weakMap.delete(key)`
- `weakMap.has(key)`

## Use case: additional data

The main area of application for `WeakMap` is an _additional data storage_.

If some data are belong to an object, and the object we are not create it directly, we can "bind" these data to the object by `WeakMap`. When the object is garbage collected, that data will automatically disappear as well.

## Use case: caching

When a function result should be remembered, so that future calls on the same object reuse it.

```js
let cache = new WeakMap();

// calculate and remember the result
function process(obj) {
  if (!cache.has(obj)) {
    let result = /* calculate the result for */ obj;

    cache.set(obj, result);
  }

  return cache.get(obj);
}

// üìÅ main.js
let obj = {/* some object */};

let result1 = process(obj);
let result2 = process(obj);

// ...later, when the object is not needed any more:
obj = null;

// Can't get cache.size, as it's a WeakMap,
// but it's 0 or soon be 0
// When obj gets garbage collected, cached data will be removed as well
```

> V: It means, if you have a function to get a result with an object, you can use the object as a key, the result as a value, to store the result. It only calculate the result at first time.

## WeakSet

`WeakSet` behaves similarly:

- It is analogous to `Set`, but we may only add objects to Weak`Set (not primitives).
- An object exists in the set while it is reachable from somewhere else.
- Like `Set`, it supports `add`, `has` and `delete`, but not `size`, `keys()` and no iterations.

Being ‚Äúweak‚Äù, it also serves as an additional storage. But not for an arbitrary data, but rather for ‚Äúyes/no‚Äù facts. A membership in `WeakSet` may mean something about the object.

```js
let visitedSet = new WeakSet();

let john = { name: "John" };
let pete = { name: "Pete" };
let mary = { name: "Mary" };

visitedSet.add(john); // John visited us
visitedSet.add(pete); // Then Pete
visitedSet.add(john); // John again

// visitedSet has 2 users now

// check if John visited?
alert(visitedSet.has(john)); // true

// check if Mary visited?
alert(visitedSet.has(mary)); // false

john = null;

// visitedSet will be cleaned automatically
```
