# Date and time

## Creation

`new Date()`

`new Date(milliseconds)`

The _timestamp_ beginning from 1970. Convert the existing `Date` object to a timestamp using the `date.getTime()` method.

```js
// 31 Dec 1969
let Dec31_1969 = new Date(-24 * 3600 * 1000);
```

`new Date(datestring)`. This method's algorithm is the same as `Date.parse` uses.

`new Date(year, month, date, hours, minutes, seconds, ms)`

The first two arguments are obligatory. And the `year` must have 4 digits, the `month` count starts with `0`. The default `date` is `1`, and the others default value are `0`.

## Some Methods

## Autocorrection

The _autocorrections_ is a very handy feature of `Date` objects. We can set out-of-range values, and it will auto-adjust itself.

## Date to number, date diff

Convert `Date` object to number, it's the same as `date.getTime()`.

Can subtract two `Date` objects, the result is their difference in ms.

## Date.now()

We can get current time by `Date.now()`, it doesn't create an intermediate `Date` object.

## Benchmarking

## Date.parse from a string

`YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss.sssZ`
