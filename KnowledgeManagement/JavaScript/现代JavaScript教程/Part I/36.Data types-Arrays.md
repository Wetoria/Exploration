# Arrays

## Declaration

```js
let arr = new Array();
let arr = [];

arr.length;

arr[0] = 'new';
```

## Methods pop/push, shift/unshift

- `push` - appends an element to the end.
- `pop` - takes an element from the end.
- `shift` - get an element from the beginning, advancing the queue, so that the 2nd element becomes the 1st.
- `unshift` - add the element to the beginning of the array.

## Internals

Do not use array as a regular object, Arrays are carefully tuned inside JavaScript engines to work with contiguous ordered data.

## Performance

Methods `push/pop` run fast, while `shift/unshift` are slow.

## Loops

`for loop`, `for...of`, `for...in`.

Generally, we shouldn't use `for...in` for arrays.

## A word about "length"

The `length` automatically updates when we modify the array. It is actually not the count of values in the array, but the greatest numberic index plus one.

If we increase it manually, nothing interesting happens. But if we decrease it, the array is truncated. The process is irreversible.

The simplest way to clear the array is: `arr.length = 0`;

## new Array()

If `new Array()` called with a single number, it will create an array without items, _but with the given length_.

## Multidimensional arrays

```js
let matrix = [
  [1, 2, 3],
  [4, 5, 6],
  [7, 8, 9],
];
```

## toString

Arrays have their own implementation of `toString` method that returns a comma-separated list of elements.
