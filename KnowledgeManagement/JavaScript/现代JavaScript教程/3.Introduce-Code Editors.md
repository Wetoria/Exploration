# Code Editors

## IDE

IDE - Integrated Development Environment, it's not just an editor, but a full-scale "development environment".

- __Visual Studio Code__ (cross-platform, free).
- __WebStorm__ (cross-platform, paid).

## Lightweight editors

Lightweight editors are mainly used to open and edit a file __instantly__.


- __Atom__ (cross-platform, free).
- __Sublime Text__ (cross-platform, free).
- __Notepad++__ (Windows, free).
- __Vim__ and __Emacs__. Need to learn how to use them.
