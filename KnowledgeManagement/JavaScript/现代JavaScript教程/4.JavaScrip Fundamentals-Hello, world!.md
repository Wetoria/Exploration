# Hello, world!

## The "script" tag

You can use `<script>` tag to add Javascript programs into any part of an HTML document.

## External scipts
You can organize your JavaScript as a file, like `script.js`.

Then you can add it to a HTML file like below:
```html
<script src="/path/script.js"></script>
```

Here, `/path/script.js` is an absolute path to the script from the site root. You also can use relative path.

> __NOTICE:__  
>
> Only the simplest scripts are put into HTML. More complex ones reside in separate files.  
>
> Use a separate file, can allow the browser to download it and store it in its __cache__.


> __WARNING:__
>
> The contents of a `<script>` tag will be ignored, when you set `src`.

## Modern markup

- __`type` attribute:__

The old HTML standrad, HTML4, required a script to have a `type`.

- __`language` attribute:__

There is no need to use it.
