# Variables

# A variable

Use `let` keyword to create a variable.
```js
let variable;
```

Use `=` to set a value to a variable.
```js
variable = 'value';
```

Also can put above steps at one line.
```js
let variable = 'value';
```

After you put some value to a variable, you can use it.
```js
alert(variable).
```

You can create multi variables in one lines. But for easier to read, do not use this way.
```js
let variableOne = 'value1', variableTwo = 'value2';
```

## Variable naming

1. The name must contain only __letters__, __digits__, or `$` and `_`.
2. The first character must not be a digit.

If your variable contains multiple words, `camelCase` is commonly uses.

> __JavaScript is case matters.__
>
> apple and ApplE are to different variables.

> You can use any language to declare a variable, but not recommended.

> __Reserved names__.
>
> Some words in the [list of reserved words](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Lexical_grammar#Keywords), can not be used as variable name.


> If you don't enable `strict mode`, you can use `variable = 'value'` to declare a variable. But it's not a good way to use in a project.


## Constants

Use `const` to create a constant variable, which is __unchanging.__

### Uppercase constatns

There is a widespread practice to use constants as aliases for diffcult-to-remember values that are known prior to execution.

## Name things right

Use human-readable names. No matter the human-readable name is to long, as long as the name is readable, use it to create a variable.
