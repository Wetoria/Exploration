# The modern mode, "use strict"

JavaScript evolved without compatibility issues. So, __to keep the old code working, most modifications are off by default. You need to use `use strict` to explicity enable them.__

## "use strict"

Add `"use strict"` or `'use strict'` at the top of a script, the whole script will works as the "modern" way.

> __Ensure that "use strict" is at the top.__ Only comments allowed to appear above `"use strict"`.

> __There is no way to cancel `"use strict"`__


## Browser console

Use multiline to enable "use strict" mode. The console will disable `"use strict"` as default mode.

To ensure enable, use below function:
```js
(function() {
  'use strict';
})();
```
